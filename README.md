# telegram-bot
hello there convegenius team,
Thank you for the oppurtunity ,
your assignment was challenging yet interesting.

i was managed to create it but i was still trying to store data or user but the time we were provided over,

i wish to finish it soon..i hope you would see my code,
thank you

I also deployed it but it doesnt seems to work
here is the heroku deployed link : https://boiling-ravine-36251.herokuapp.com/

and my Telegram bot name was @tele1_covid_bot


from this line i am showing you a deployed basic working telegram bot so that you have an idea that i can deploy
tele bot name @etpr1_bot     //its working
deployed link https://telebot312.herokuapp.com/ 
this was just for practice
thank you.
regards 
Yogesh kumar
